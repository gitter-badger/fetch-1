# fetch

This is the home of my fetch script! This script gathers info <br />
about your system and prints it to the terminal next to an image, <br \>
your distro's logo or any ascii art of your choice!

<!-- Features {{{ -->


## Features

- Supports **Linux**, **Mac OS X**, **BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD & NetBSD)** and **Windows** (Cygwin)
- Display a **full color image**, a file containing **ascii art** or your **distro's logo** in ascii next to the info.
- The script is **fast**. We use bash builtins wherever possible and only spawn external processes when necessary.
- Take a screenshot of your desktop on script finish.
- Customize **which** info is displayed, **where** it's displayed and **when** it's displayed.
    - See this **[wiki page](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Customizing-Info)**

<!-- Dependences {{{ -->


## Dependencies


### Required dependencies:

-  `Bash 4.0+`
-  `procps-ng`
    - Not required on OS X


### Optional dependencies:

- Displaying images: `w3m-img` \[1\] or `iTerm2` \[2\]
- Thumbnail creation: `imagemagick`

##### Linux / BSD

- Window Manager: `wmctrl` \[3\]
- Wallpaper: `feh`, `nitrogen` or `gsettings`
- Current Song: `mpc` or `cmus`
- Resolution: `xorg-xdpyinfo`
- Screenshot: `scrot` \[4\]

\[1\] `w3m-img` is sometimes bundled together with `w3m`.

\[2\] You can enable the `iTerm2` image backend by using the launch flag `--image_backend iterm2` or by<br \>
changing the config option `$image_backend` to `iterm2`.

\[3\] You should install wmctrl if the builtin window manager detection isn't working for you. The builtin<br \>
detection works for most people and is generally faster which is why wmctrl isn't default.

\[4\] You can use the launch flag `--scrot_cmd` or change the config option `$scrot_cmd` to your screenshot<br \>
program's cmd and fetch will use it instead of scrot.

<!-- Installation {{{ -->


## Installation


### Arch

1. Install **[fetch-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fetch-git/)** from the aur.


### Gentoo / Funtoo

1. Add the 3rd party repo
    - `layman -o https://gist.githubusercontent.com/z1lt0id/24d45b15800b98975260/raw/2fdf6645cdc3c1ca0b0af83a7bf8f86598e386ae/fs0ciety.xml -f -a fs0ciety`
2. Sync the repos
    - `layman -S`
3. To enable w3m and scrot support, enable the appropriate flags.
    - `echo "x11-apps/fetch" >> /etc/portage/package.use`
4. Install the package
    - `emerge -a x11-apps/fetch`


### Others

1. Download the latest source at https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch
2. Run `make install` inside the script directory to install the script.
    - **El Captain**: `PREFIX=/usr/local make install`

**NOTE:** Fetch can be uninstalled easily using `make uninstall`.

**NOTE:** Fetch can also be run from any directory like a normal script,<br \>
you'll just be missing the ascii distro logos and automatic config file creation.

<!-- Post Install {{{ -->


## Post Install


#### Using the config file

Fetch will by default create a config file at `$HOME/.config/fetch/config` and this file<br \>
contains all of the script's options/settings. The config file allows you to keep your<br \>
customizations between script versions and allows you to easily share your customizations<br \>
with other people.

You can launch the script without a config file by using the flag `--config none` and you can<br \>
specify a custom config location using `--config path/to/config`.


#### Sizing the image correctly

**NOTE:** For the images to be sized correctly you need to set the `$font_width` variable.<br \>
If you don't know your font width in pixels keep trying values until the image is half the<br \>
terminal width.

Once `font_width` is set the image will by default take up half the terminal width. You can<br \>
use the launch flag `--size px` or change the config option `$image_size` to set it to a custom<br \>
size in pixels.

You can also use the launch flag `--font_width` to set it on the fly.


#### Setting the prompt height

If your shell prompt's height is greater than 1 line high, you'll need to change a config<br \>
option to avoid issues with the top lines in the script output getting cut off. Set the variable<br \>
`$prompt_height` to your shell prompt's height in lines or use the launch flag `--prompt_height`.


#### Customizing what info gets displayed

In the config file there's a function that allows you to customize all of the info that<br \>
gets displayed.

Here's what you can do:

- Add new info lines
- Change the ordering of the info
- Remove unwanted info lines
- Use bash syntax to control when info gets displayed

See this wiki page that goes more in-depth about it:

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Customizing-Info


#### Customizing the script using a custom alias

If you don't want to use the config file you can customize almost everything using launch flags!

Here's what my fetch alias looks like:

```sh
alias fetch2="fetch \
--block_range 1 8 \
--line_wrap off \
--bold off \
--uptime_shorthand on \
--gtk_shorthand on \
--colors 4 1 8 8 8 7 \
"
```

<!-- Frequently Asked Questions {{{ -->


## Frequently Asked Questions


#### How do I enable screenfetch mode?

Launching the script with `--ascii distro` or setting `ascii="distro"` and `image="ascii"` <br \>
inside the config file will launch the script in "screenfetch mode". The script will<br \>
display your distro's ascii next to the info, exactly like screenfetch.

**NOTE:** If you don't have `w3m-img` or `imagemagick` installed screenfetch mode will be<br \>
used automatically

![arch](http://i.imgur.com/uCMjgf6.png)


#### Why doesn't fetch support my wallpaper setter?

It's hard to add support for other wallpaper setters as they don't provide a way of <br \>
getting the current wallpaper from the cli.

If your wallpaper setter **does** provide a way of getting the current wallpaper or you<br \>
know where it's stored then adding support won't be a problem!<br \>

<!-- Issues and Workarounds {{{ -->


## Issues and Workarounds


#### The text is too long for my terminal window and wraps to the next line

There are a few ways to fix this.

* Disable line wrapping with `line_wrap=off` in the script or with the launch flag `--line_wrap off`
* The uptime and gtk info lines each have a shorthand option that makes their output smaller. You can <br \>
  enable them by changing these variables or using these flags.

```sh
# Config options
uptime_shorthand="on"
gtk_shorthand="on"
gpu_shorthand="on"
birthday_shorthand="on"

# Launch flags
--uptime_shorthand on
--gtk_shorthand on
--gpu_shorthand on
--birthday_shorthand on

```

* Edit the config to make the subtitles shorter
* Resizing the terminal so that the lines don't wrap.


#### The text is pushed over too far to the right

The easiest way to fix this is to change the value of `--gap` or `$gap`<br \>
to a negative value. For example `--gap -10` will move the text 10 spaces to the left.


#### getgpu doesn't show my exact video card name

If your `lspci | grep "VGA"` output looks like this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1401 (rev a1)
```

Instead of this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM206 [GeForce GTX 960] (rev a1)
```

Then you're affected by the issue.

This is caused by your `/usr/share/misc/pci.ids\*` files being outdated and you can fix it<br \>
by running this command as root.

```
sudo update-pciids
```
